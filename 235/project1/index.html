                    I am computer programmer, software engineer, graphic designer, and game designer/developer for digital and physical games. First and foremost, I am a problem solver who loves technology, which naturally led me down the self-taught path to programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When presented with a problem, I try to find the cleanest and most efficient answer. If it turns out that my solution isn't as smooth as I want, I like to keep trying new things until something sticks, and learn from all the mistakes and failed projects along the way. Although this leaves behind a sad graveyard of "could have been" projects, it makes the ones that survive shine that much more.

                        Trial by Combat is a local 2-player 2D tactics game developed using C# and Monogame. In this group project, I created the map loading logic as well as the external tool used to draw, save, and edit the maps for the game. Additionally, I was the production manager, organizing meetings, timelines, and goals. In meetings and while working remotely, I often ended up acting as the group leader, coordinating our efforts and ensuring everyone had something productive to work on.

                        The foremost goal of this project was to create a functional, believable, and fun physics system based on what I have learned over the years. Because of this, the very first thing I did was manually add in basic tools such as vectors, rectangles, collision detection, and kinematic objects with masses that can have forces applied to them. Making these physics (and the player controls) feel tight and smooth took a lot of testing, but after reconsidering various approaches I finally got the game to feel right. After that I focused on designing interesting puzzles that made the most out of what I found fun during physics testing: getting to high places, and throwing things across the room.

                        Having been my first ever Game Jam, my personal goal for the project was to just finish <em>something</em> playable by the end of the strict time limit. However, as the project progressed, our team realized we were managing to make something good, something we genuinely enjoyed playing and testing. The simplicity of the concept allowed us to make a much more refined and engaging experience than we would have otherwise been able to do. Additionally, my ability to perform well under a harsh time constraint proved to myself that I can work under pressure and with tight deadlines. As an example, I wrote code for triggers that could activate other objects around the room, but we decided to cut the feature from the level design itself due to time constraints. Often, the hardest part of a project is letting go of things that you put hard work into, but in cases like these sometimes a feature has to be cut and the best thing to do is simply move on.

                        This project was my first deep-dive into utilizing a webAPI, so while working on it my primary goal was to learn how to smoothly pull data from a greater database and implement it cleanly into my own website. Since in the past I've usually been able to alter any given part of the code I'm working on, adjusting to be able to handle a predetermined, rigid source of data was difficult and added extra complexity to my JavaScript. For example, the PokéAPI has info on pokémon <em>species</em> and <em>individual</em> pokémon (such as various forms of the same species). Figuring out how to translate between these two data types was difficult, but by studying the API and how it is structured I managed to get my website to work how I wanted it to.
